### What is U-Net Model? 
**U-Net is a convolutional neural network that was developed for biomedical image segmentation.** The network is based on a fully convolutional neural network whose architecture was modified and extended to work with fewer training images and to yield more precise segmentation. Segmentation of a 512 × 512 image takes less than a second on a modern GPU.

**The U-Net architecture has also been employed in diffusion models for iterative image denoising.** This technology underlies many modern image generation models, such as DALL-E and Midjourney.
